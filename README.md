# MEML Splat Library
## Overview
This library is a set of tools which were created to develop immersive narrative experiences using Gaussian Splats. This library acts as a wrapper around three.js' [Luma WebGL Library](https://lumalabs.ai/luma-web-library) and was created in the Mobile and Environmental Media Lab (MEML) at the University of Southern California in 2024. 

The motivation for creating these tools was to harness the excitement surrounding recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields and Gaussian Splats, and create an immersive narrative with these technologies. The result is a short VR narrative film, [The Virtual Garden](https://virtual-garden.netlify.app/).

Samples and instructions how to use this library can be found on it's [Github page](https://github.com/mwahba13/MEMLSplatLib).
